Qt6 QML is the latest and greatest technology from the Qt Framework, to build slick looking , fluid, dynamic and cross platform User Interfaces that can run mobile devices(Android, IOS, touch devices (embedded) and any major desktop platform out there(Linux, Windows, Mac). Qt Quick can be used to build stand-alone applications, but it can also be interfaced and/or extended with a C++ back end.

The main aim of this book is to *help you succeed* in becoming a *Qt Quick/QML* GUI Designer and do so in the most effective amount of time possible. The book is packed with lots of straight to the point, easy to understand  demos, that are carefully designed to help you master a given Qt6 QML  UI development topic at hand.

The target reader is anyone willing to add Qt Quick/QML UI design to their stack of skills. While Qt Quick is built on top of Qt and C++, *no knowledge of Qt or C++ is required.* The book will equally be useful to both designers willing to jump into Qt Quick and existing C++ developers willing to level up their skills in fluid UI design.

### What you should know[Important]


 - You buy the book once, and are entitled to free updated versions of the book.
 - After your purchase, it may take a minute to generate your personalized copy of the book. Once that's done, you'll get access to the book.
 - Buying the book, under construction or finished, helps the authors efforts in creating content for the Qt community out there.


### What the book covers


- *Chapter 1, First Steps with Qt QML*, provides a brief introduction to Qt and QML, describes how to get Qt and Qt Creator installed on your host system and guides you through the process of building and understanding the building blocks of your first QML application.
- *Chapter 2, Dissecting the QML Syntax*, explores the QML syntax, guides you through the process of using QML basic QML data types in a live QML application, and introduces you to property bindings. It also gets your feet wet using property handlers and explores some features of the Qt global object.
- *Chapter 3, Basic QML Elements,* explores the QML elements: Item, Rectangle, Image and Text. It also shows you how you can compose these basic, built-in QML elements to build your own custom QML components.
- *Chapter 4, Signals and Handlers,* introduces the signals and slots mechanism in QML. It explores several facilities at our disposal, helping us communicate between different QML objects.
- *Chapter 5, User Input,* navigates through the user input facilities provided by QML, helping you add interactivity to your QML applications.
- *Chapter 6, JavaScript,* sheds more light on where and how JavaScript is used in your QML code
- *Chapter 7, Positioning,* explores the positioning mechanisms offered by QML. We look at anchors, positioners, layouts and a few others.
- *Chapter 8, Qt Quick Controls,* provides a live and practical walkthrough of the Qt Quick Controls module, covering the most common controls like Button, Slider, SwipeView, Flickable and many others. They are pre-built QML components helping you build reliable and good-looking user interfaces relatively fast.
- *Chapter 9, Dialogs,* introduces to you common dialog types for use in your QML applications and explores how to build your own custom dialogs. It also shows you ways you can use built-in Qt Creator examples as a base and build your own modern-looking dialogs.
- *Chapter 10, The Model View Architecture,* explores how you can leverage the model-view architecture constructs in Qt and QML, to separate the way your data is stored from the way it is visualized. This architectural approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility. By decoupling the model, view, and delegate, you can independently modify and update each component, resulting in scalable and responsive applications.
- *Chapter 11, Transforms, Animations, States and Transitions,* walks you through some of the most powerful tools that help bring your QML user interfaces to life. Transforms are used to apply different visual transformations like rotation, scaling, and translation to items. Animations allow you to create smooth and dynamic transitions between property values over time. States and Transitions in QML facilitate defining different sets of property values and defining how these properties change when transitioning between states.
- *Chapter 12, Networking,* explores some of the built-in networking facilities that come with QML. We will use the XMLHttpRequest object to download both raw HTML and JSON data from the web. We will do the plumbing necessary for downloaded data to be displayed in a QML user interface.
- *Chapter 13, Storage,* guides you through facilities that help in persisting data on the local device. Weâ€™ll look at the Settings object and the LocalStorage module.


Qt is the platform of choice for thousands of software projects and some of the most successful companies on the planet. Learning Qt6 QML will certainly level up your abilities in taking advantage of this rich and awesome framework.
