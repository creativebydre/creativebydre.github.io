*Special note : This course is based on Qt 5. Qt 6, released in December 2020 is the latest version. We are working on updates to take  Qt 6 into account that will be completed over the next couple of months. In the mean time, we recommend using Qt 5 for the best experience with the course.*

Qt Quick (QML) is the latest and greatest technology from the Qt Framework, to build slick looking , fluid, dynamic and cross platform User Interfaces that can run mobile devices(Android,IoS, touch devices (embedded) and any major desktop platform out there(Linux,Windows,Mac). Qt Quick can be used to build stand-alone applications, but it can also be interfaced and/or extended with a C++ back end.

The main aim of this course is to help you succeed in becoming a Qt Quick/QML GUI Designer and do so in the most effective amount of time possible. The course is packed with lots of straight to the point, easy to understand  demos, that are carefully designed to help you master a given Qt Quick  UI development topic at hand.

The target student is anyone willing to add Qt Quick/QML UI design to their stack of skills. While Qt Quick is built on top of Qt and C++, no knowledge of Qt or C++ is required. The course will equally be useful to both designers willing to jump into Qt Quick and existing C++ developers willing to level up their skills in fluid UI design.

We start by getting your development environment set up and get you to run your first Qt Quick application. We then jump into topics like

    - Dissecting the QML Syntax , where we explore subjects like the QML syntax, Basic Types of QML,  Properties and Handlers,Property Binding and the Qt Quick Global Object;

    - Qt Quick Basic Elements, and look at elements like Rectangle,Text, Image and Item;

    - Signals and Slots;

    Working with Javascript, where we explore the javascript environment available to you in QML, where and how to type your Javascript code in QML files, functions and scope and importing external Javascript files;

    - User Input Elements : TextInput, TextEdit, MouseArea and drag and drop, Keys Attached Properties, KeyNavigation and FocusScope

    - Qt Quick Positioning and explore subjects like Anchors, Positioners, Layouts and Flow

    - Qt Quick on Mobile Devices : we take you on a detailed journey on how to run your Qt Quick Apps on Android and guide you on how you would do the same on IoS.

    - Qt Quick Controls  where we explore a host of Ui Components available and ready to be consumed by your awesome apps ;

    - Dialogs : ColorDialog, FileDialog,FontDialog, MessageDialog and Custom Dialogs

    - Model , View and Delegate where we explore the pieces of the puzzle needed to take advantage of the Model View Delegate Architeture in Qt Quick

    Transitions, Transforms and Animations  : Oooh Animations! This is the most fun and captivating subject for me in Qt Quick. We take you on a tour of how you animate your Qt Quick Components and bring your designs to life using tricks like states and transitions.

    - Network : We show you how to download HTTP data using XmlHttpRequest and how to consume REST APIs in your Qt Quick apps using the same Javascript Object

    - Storage : We first use the Settings component from the Qt.labs module to save and load your applications settings and do the same thing using the LocalStorage module that is backed by an embedded SQLite database.

Qt is the platform of choice for thousands of software projects and some of the most successful companies on the planet. Learning Qt Quick will certainly level up your abilities in taking advantage of this rich and awesome framework. Please check out some of the preview videos and lets get you STARTED building slick and fluid User Interfaces with Qt Quick.
